<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Extreme Performance Async Multi-Threaded TCP and UDP Port Forwarding in Rust with Tokio Runtime

## Key Features

* Asynchronous and Multi-Threaded: The port forwarding engine is designed to handle multiple connections concurrently, making efficient use of system resources.
* TCP and UDP Support: Forward traffic for both TCP and UDP protocols seamlessly.
* Configurable: Easily customize port mappings, source and destination addresses, and other settings.
* Performance Optimized: Leverage Rust’s memory safety and Tokio’s async capabilities to achieve outstanding performance.
